## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Golf is a sport who was firstly only played by elites. It basically consists to put a little ball in a hole, whith the help of a wide array of differents stick, commonly called clubs. A golf course has 18 holes and every all is allocated a number of shots which should normal. Those standars are 3,4 and 5. The number of shots allocated to a hole is defined by distance. Logically the longest it is, the more shot a player will have.

The PGA tour is the greatest circuit of golf in the world. Only the best player may earn a card to play on it. A regular competition is played on 4 days, and all the scores are cumulated. However after 2 days a cut is made and only the 70 best player are allowed to continue.

We tried to find many database but as none of them where satisfying we decided to form it all by our selves.
We went on the PGA tour website and we selected variables which seemed the most appropriate according our knowledge.

Definition :
putts
fairway
green
rough




Datas were scrapped from the PGA Tour website by using this function:

```{r}

scraping <- function(link, date){
  webpage <- link %>% read_html()
  
  tbls_ls <- webpage %>%
    html_nodes("table") %>%
    .[2] %>%
    html_table(fill = TRUE)
  
  Variable <-Variable(tbls_ls[[1]])
  
  Variable <- Variable[,-c(1,2,4,6,7)]
  Variable <- Variable %>% 
    rename(NAME = `PLAYER NAME`, 
           "Variable" = Variable)
  
  Year <- nrow (Variable)
  Variable$Year <- rep(date, time= nrow (Variable))
  return(Variable)
}

```

Our data base is the following 

```{r}

knitr::kable(dbfinal1)


```

As those variables here are some further details about what they represent:

rounds : number of round played during the year, a unit of round is equivalent to one day in a tournament.
distance : This is the distance covered in average by the shot hit with the driver, which is the club that covers the most distance
accuracy : It is a ratio between the number of drive that did land on the fairway and the total amount of drive attempted
gir : It is the also a ratio between the number of times that the player did reach the green in -2 shots than the par over the total of holes played
approach : distance left to the hole in average after a shot from 20-30 meters
putts : number of putts taken per round in average
cuts : consecutive numbers of time that a player did qualify for the 3 and 4 day of a tournament
score : average score, which corresponds to the number of shot played
lscore: average number of shot played the last day
Top10 : number of times a player did finish in the Top 10
